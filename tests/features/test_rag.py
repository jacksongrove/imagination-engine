"""
Feature tests for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities for OpenAI (Anthropic not supported).

This tests the following features:
1. Text file processing by OpenAI agents
2. Image file processing by OpenAI agents
3. Handling of large text files without truncation
4. Proper error handling for unsupported file types
